# Katas
A kata is an exercise in karate where you repeat a form many, many times, making little improvements in each. The intent behind code kata is similar. (http://codekata.com)

This repository contains some of the Katas I've done to exercise my logic, TDD, or to show/teach someone about it.

I usually get my Katas from this site: https://www.codurance.com/katas
